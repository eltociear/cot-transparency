       "3    Nowadays, children's homework is not just their own business.Most parents of primary and secondary school students have to face the task of accompanying their children with homework, including dictating, checking homework and signing.According to a survey of more than 3,000 parents, 84% of parents will accompany their children to write homework every day, while 67% of parents surveyed will be troubled by their children.Some experts pointed out that parents accompanied their children to write homework, which is equivalent to acting as an assistant to the school teacher, making the family an extension of the classroom, which will adversely affect the growth of the child.\\n\\nWhich of the following, if true, will best support the above experts' judgment?\\n\\nAnswer choices:\\n(A) Parents should not focus on the homework assigned by the teacher, but should focus on inspiring children's interest in learning, cultivating children's good learning habits, and making children feel new and happy when they grow up.\\n(B) Parents usually have their own work, some have to work overtime at night, and some need to do research work and housework even if they go home at night.It is generally difficult to have the energy to complete the \"homework\" assigned by the school teacher.\\n(C) Parents are the best teachers.Parents counseling their children to acquire all kinds of knowledge is what it means for family education.For children in middle and low grades, parental companionship in the learning process is particularly important.\\n(D) Parents accompany their children to write homework, which will make the children lack independence and initiative in learning.All day long, under the dual pressure of teachers and parents, it is difficult to develop interest in learning and to develop an independent personality.\\n(E) None of the above\\n\\nPlease think step by step.\\n\\nThe experts' judgment is that parents accompanying their children to write homework will adversely affect the growth of the...   \n",

This weakens the argument because it suggests that the higher yield in the east is not due to the application of the fertilizer.\\n\\n(B) This answer choice talks about the use of potassium persulfate element fertilizer in the north of the field, but it doesn't provide any information about how it affects the yield of the corn in the east and west fields. This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.\\n\\n(C) This answer choice mentions that four types of corn are planted in each field. However, it doesn't provide any information about how this affects the yield or the impact of the fertilizer. This answer choice is not relevant to the argument.\\n\\n(D) If the soil qualities of the two plots in the east and west are different, it could explain the difference in yield between the two fields. This suggests that the higher yield in the east is not solely due to the application of the fertilizer, but rather due to the differences in soil quality.
